This script is designed to automatically differentiate between panoramic and standard images. Utilizing image processing techniques, it analyzes the aspect ratio and metadata of an image to categorize it. If the aspect ratio exceeds a predefined threshold, the image is classified as panoramic. Additionally, the script checks for panoramic-specific metadata tags that are often embedded in such images. The output is a simple classification indicating whether the image is panoramic or standard, allowing users to efficiently sort and manage their image collections based on the image type. This tool is particularly useful for photographers and digital asset managers who deal with large volumes of images.
